		California agriculture boosted the state's economy as well as giving the miners during the time a food source. Many people went to the state specifically for its agriculture, while others came to the state as miners and switched to farming later on.
		<br>
		<br>
		The main cash crops were wheat and grapes. Wheat was for bread, and grapes were to make wine for the miners, the majority of whom had a concerning love of drinking.
		Cattle was mostly cows and bulls for beef. This was extremely profitable for many, to the point where many led extremely expensive and lavish lives. They didn't predict a drop in beef demand, however, so many went bankrupt after the gold rush.
