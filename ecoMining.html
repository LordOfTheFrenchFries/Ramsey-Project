	<body id="caption">In 1848, James Marsell found gold while trying to set up a water powered sawmill. He tried to keep this discovery hidden, but one of his workers eventually let the secret out. The news spread quickly, and thousands flodded into California, marking the beggining of the gold rush.
<br><br>
Many of the people going in were miners, but a few who already had some money decided to start selling pickaxes, shovel, and other supplies for mining and living on the land. These people became some of the biggest benifactors of the gold rush, only behind the lucky, lucky few who found gold and struck it rich. The rest of the miners had three options: either earn a little money and live poor, switch to Californias "Green Gold" (farming) or dying (this ones the bad option).
<br><br>
The gold rush had two major roles in westward expansion: it jumpstarted Californias population and brought hundreds more to the surrounding areas, making a huge step in connecting the Unites States from ocean to ocean.</body>
